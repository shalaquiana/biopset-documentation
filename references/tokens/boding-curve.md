# Boding Curve

The "Late Stage" Bonding Curve(LSBC) is a mechanism designed to ensure that a option to buy and sell $BIOP exists indefinitely. It allows users to buy or sell BIOP for $ETH. It can only sell $BIOP tokens up to the total amount that has been placed inside at it's activation time and cannot give out more $ETH then has been sent to it by users purchasing $BIOP.

It is a AMM(automated Market Maker) which will not be activated until after the rewards period for BIOP/ETH stakers on DEXs(decentralized Exchanges) has ended.  

Until the LSBC is activated the tokens for it will be held in a multi sig address requiring multi party consent from Munair, Dereek69, and Shalaquiana for any transfer. Once the tokens are transfered into the LSBC they cannot be removed except by purchasing them for ETH.
